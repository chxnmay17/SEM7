# **Do We Still Need to Study Algorithms? – Justification**

## **1. Short Answer**

**Yes.**
Even with the **fastest computer** and **infinite memory**, studying algorithms is essential because **time complexity, scalability, correctness, and practicality** still matter.

---

## **2. Reasons (DAA Perspective)**

1. **Scalability**

   * Real-world problems often involve **huge input sizes** (billions/trillions).
   * Example: Processing data from **social media platforms** — inefficient algorithms may take **years**, even on supercomputers.

2. **Optimization**

   * Resources like **energy consumption** and **network bandwidth** are still limited.
   * Efficient algorithms reduce **operating cost**.

3. **Correctness**

   * A fast computer executing a **wrong algorithm** → **fast wrong answers**.
   * Example: Banking transaction algorithm error → financial losses.

4. **Parallel & Distributed Systems**

   * Cloud computing and GPUs need algorithms optimized for **parallel execution**.

5. **Maintainability & Readability**

   * Algorithm design principles ensure code is **understandable and modifiable**.

---

## **3. Real-World Example**

* **Naive matrix multiplication (O(n³))** vs. **Strassen’s algorithm (O(n^2.81))**:

  * For *n = 1 million*, even supercomputers face huge time differences.
  * Faster algorithm saves **days/weeks**.

## **4. Diagram – Why Algorithms Matter**

```
Problem Size ↑
   |
   |         Fastest Computer
   |          ┌───────────────┐
   |          │   Still slow  │  ← Bad Algorithm
   |          └───────────────┘
   |
   └────────────────────────────────→ Time
        Efficient Algorithm = Practical Solution
```

✅ **Exam Tip**:
Remember **S-O-C-P-M** → Scalability, Optimization, Correctness, Parallelism, Maintainability.

If you want, I can also combine **this**, **loop invariant**, and **algorithms vs technology** into a **single one-page DAA revision sheet** so you can quickly review all 3 in **under a minute** before the exam. Would you like me to prepare that?
