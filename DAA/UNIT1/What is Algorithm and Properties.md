## Definition
- An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions for solving a problem or performing a computation.
- It takes input, processes it step-by-step, and produces an output in a finite amount of time.

## Properties of a Good Algorithm

1. **Input**
   - An algorithm should have zero or more inputs.
   - Example: Sorting algorithm takes an unsorted list as input.
   
2. **Output**
   - Must produce at least one output.
   - Example: Sorted list after applying sorting algorithm.
   
3. **Finiteness**
   - Algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
   - Example: Binary Search stops when element is found or interval is empty.
   
4. **Definiteness**
   - Each step should be clear, precise, and unambiguous.
   - No vague instructions allowed.
   
5. **Effectiveness**
   - Steps must be basic enough to be carried out using available resources within reasonable time.
   - Example: Arithmetic operations like +, –, × are effective.
   
6. **Generality**
   - Algorithm should be applicable to a class of problems, not just one specific case.
   - Example: Euclid’s GCD algorithm works for any pair of integers.
