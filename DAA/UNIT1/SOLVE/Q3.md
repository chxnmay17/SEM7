### i) Is this code fragment efficient?

No, this code fragment is **not efficient**, even for a linear search.

**Justification:**

The main reason for its inefficiency is that it **fails to use the critical information that the array `A` is already sorted**.

* In a sorted array, if you're searching for a number `x` and you find an element `A[i]` that is **greater than** `x`, you can stop searching immediately. You know `x` cannot be in the rest of the array because all subsequent elements will also be greater.
* The provided code doesn't do this. For example, if searching for `x = 25` in the array `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, an efficient search would stop after checking `30`. This algorithm, however, continues to check `40` and `50`, performing unnecessary work.

### ii) Does it attribute to any design issue?

Yes, the code has **three significant design issues**. üßë‚Äçüíª

1.  **The Undeclared Variable `n`**: This is the most fundamental flaw. The variable `n` (the array's size) is used in the loop condition (`while (i<n)`) but is **never passed as a parameter or defined in the function**. In languages like C/C++, an array passed to a function doesn't carry its size information. This code would fail to compile due to an "undeclared identifier" error. The function signature must be changed to `int lin_search(int A[], int n)` to fix this.

2.  **Incorrect Loop Choice**: The use of a `do-while` loop is a critical bug. A `do-while` loop always executes its body at least once. If this function were called with an empty array (`n=0`), it would still try to access `A[0]`, causing an **out-of-bounds memory access** and likely crashing the program. The correct choice would be a `for` or `while` loop, which checks the condition *before* the first iteration.

3.  **Unused Variable**: The variable `flag` is initialized (`flag=0;`) but is **never used again**. This is "dead code" and is considered poor programming practice. It makes the code harder to read and maintain.
