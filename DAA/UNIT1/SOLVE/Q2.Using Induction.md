We want to prove the proposition $P(n)$: The function `fact(n)` correctly computes $n!$ for all non-negative integers $n \ge 0$.

The mathematical definition of a factorial is:
* $0! = 1$
* $n! = n \times (n-1)!$ for $n > 0$

### Proof by Induction

#### 1. Base Case

First, we must show that the proposition $P(n)$ holds for the smallest value, $n=0$.
* **Proposition $P(0)$:** The function `fact(0)` correctly computes $0!$.
* **Algorithm Execution:** When `fact(0)` is called, the condition `if (n==0)` is true. The function executes `return 1;`.
* **Verification:** According to the mathematical definition, $0! = 1$. The algorithm returns 1.
* **Conclusion:** The algorithm is correct for the base case. ✅

---

#### 2. Inductive Step

Next, we must show that if the proposition $P(k)$ is true for some arbitrary integer $k \ge 0$, then it must also be true for $P(k+1)$.

* **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume $P(k)$ is true. That is, assume `fact(k)` correctly computes and returns the value of $k!$.

* **Proof for $P(k+1)$:** Now we need to prove that `fact(k+1)` correctly computes $(k+1)!$.
    * **Algorithm Execution:** When `fact(k+1)` is called, since $k+1 > 0$, the condition `if (n==0)` is false. The function proceeds to the `else` block and executes `return (n * fact(n-1));`.
    * Substituting $n$ with $k+1$, this line becomes: `return ((k+1) * fact((k+1)-1));`, which simplifies to `return ((k+1) * fact(k));`.
    * **Applying the Hypothesis:** According to our inductive hypothesis, the call `fact(k)` will correctly return the value $k!$. We can substitute this result into the expression. The function will therefore return `(k+1) * k!`.
    * **Verification:** By the mathematical definition of factorial, $(k+1)! = (k+1) \times k!$. This matches the value returned by the algorithm.
    * **Conclusion:** The algorithm is also correct for $k+1$. ✅

### Final Conclusion

Since we have proven that the **base case** is correct and the **inductive step** is correct, we can conclude by the principle of mathematical induction that the algorithm `fact(n)` correctly computes the factorial of any non-negative integer $n$.
