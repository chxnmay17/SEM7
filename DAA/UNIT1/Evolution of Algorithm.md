## 🧠 **The Evolution of Algorithms – A Timeline**

---

### 📜 **Ancient Origins**

* **\~500 BC – Pāṇini's(Maheshwari Sutra):**
  Developed grammatical rules for Sanskrit, using algorithmic structures.

* **\~300 BC – Euclid:**
  Created the **Euclidean algorithm** for computing the GCD of two numbers.

* **\~800 AD – Al-Khwarizmi:**
  Introduced systematic methods for solving equations. The word *algorithm* comes from his name.

---

### 📐 **Mathematical Foundations (1600–1800s)**

* **1600s – Newton & Others:**
  Created systematic numerical methods (e.g., root-finding).

* **1809 – Carl Gauss:**
  Developed algorithms like **Gaussian elimination** for solving systems of equations.

* **1847 – George Boole:**
  Invented **Boolean algebra**, the logic foundation of digital computing.

---

### 🧮 **Theoretical Computation (1900–1950s)**

* **1936 – Alan Turing:**
  Proposed the **Turing Machine**, defining what problems can be solved by algorithms.

* **1940s–50s – First Computers:**
  Algorithms shifted from theory to practical implementation on electronic machines.

---

### ⚙️ **Efficiency and Analysis (1960s–1980s)**

* **1960s – Donald Knuth:**
  Formalized **algorithm analysis**, introduced **Big-O notation**, and wrote *The Art of Computer Programming*.

* **1970s – Complexity Theory:**
  Problems categorized into **P**, **NP**, and **NP-complete** classes.

* **Design Techniques Identified:**
  Such as **Divide & Conquer**, **Greedy algorithms**, and **Dynamic Programming**.

---

### 🤖 **Modern Era (1990s–Today)**

* **1990s – Randomized & Approximation Algorithms:**
  Used for solving intractable (NP-hard) problems efficiently.

* **2000s – Parallel & Distributed Algorithms:**
  Enabled by multi-core processors and cloud computing.

* **2010s–2020s – AI & Machine Learning:**
  Algorithms powering **Google’s PageRank**, **RSA encryption**, **deep learning**, and more.

* **2020s–Present – Frontier Algorithms:**
  Emerging in **quantum computing**, **blockchain**, and **big data** analytics.
