*Comment on the Statement"Best case analysis of algorithm may not give clear idea of performance"*

---

## **Comment**

* **Best Case Analysis**:
  Describes the running time of an algorithm under the **most favorable input conditions**.
  Example: Linear search finds the target in the first position → $O(1)$.

* **Why It May Not Give a Clear Idea**:

  1. **Rarely Occurs in Practice** – Best case is often an exceptional situation, not representative of real-world scenarios.
  2. **Can Be Misleading** – An algorithm with excellent best case but poor average/worst case might perform badly in reality.
  3. **Ignores Unfavorable Inputs** – Does not account for majority of cases where performance might be worse.

* **Example**:

  * **Linear Search**:

    * Best Case → $O(1)$ (target at first index)
    * Worst Case → $O(n)$ (target absent or at last index)
      → Best case does not reflect typical performance.

✅ **Exam Tip**:
In analysis, **average** and **worst** cases are preferred for realistic performance estimation, while best case alone can give a **false sense of efficiency**.
