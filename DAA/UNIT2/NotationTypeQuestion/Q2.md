*"Is 6n³ = Θ(n²)? Justify"*

# **Is 6n³ = Θ(n²)? – Justification**

## **1. Recall Θ-Notation Definition**

* **f(n) = Θ(g(n))** if **∃ positive constants** c₁, c₂, and n₀ such that:

$$
c_1 \cdot g(n) \le f(n) \le c_2 \cdot g(n), \quad \forall n \ge n_0
$$

---

## **2. Given**

* **f(n) = 6n³**
* **g(n) = n²**

---

## **3. Check Upper Bound (O(n²))**

* We test if $6n^3 \le c_2 \cdot n^2$ for large n.
* Dividing by $n^2$:
  $6n \le c_2$ → **Not true** for large n (since n → ∞).
  ✅ **Conclusion**: **6n³ is NOT O(n²)** → cannot be Θ(n²).

---

## **4. Final Conclusion**

* Since Θ-notation requires **both upper and lower bounds**, and **O(n²)** fails:

$$
6n^3 \ne \Theta(n^2)
$$

* **Reason**: n³ grows faster than n²; f(n) is actually **Θ(n³)**.

✅ **Exam Tip**: Always compare growth rates; higher-degree polynomial terms dominate for large n.
