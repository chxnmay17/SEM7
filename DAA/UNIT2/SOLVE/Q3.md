The code implements a **Linear Search**, which sequentially checks each element of an array until a match is found or the entire array has been searched. üïµÔ∏è

### Best Case Analysis: $O(1)$

The **best-case** scenario occurs when the `item` being searched for is the **very first element** of the array (`a[0]`).

* **Analysis**: In this situation, the `for` loop starts at `i = 0`. The first comparison, `if (a[0] == item)`, is immediately true. The function then returns, and the loop terminates after only one iteration.
* **Complexity**: The number of operations is constant and does not depend on the size of the array (`n`). Therefore, the best-case time complexity is **$O(1)$** (constant time).

***

### Worst Case Analysis: $O(n)$

The **worst-case** scenario occurs under two conditions:
1.  The `item` is the **very last element** in the array.
2.  The `item` is **not present** in the array at all.

* **Analysis**: In both of these situations, the algorithm must traverse the entire array. The `for` loop will run from `i = 0` to `n-1`, making a comparison at every single step. Only after checking all `n` elements will the algorithm either find the item at the last position or exit the loop and return -1.
* **Complexity**: The number of comparisons is directly proportional to the size of the array, `n`. Thus, the worst-case time complexity is **$O(n)$** (linear time).

***

### Average Case Analysis: $O(n)$

The **average-case** analysis assumes that the `item` is present in the array and is equally likely to be at any position.

* **Analysis**: To find the `item` at the first position, 1 comparison is needed. For the second position, 2 comparisons are needed, and so on, up to `n` comparisons for the last position. To find the average, we sum the number of comparisons for each position and divide by the total number of positions (`n`):
    $$\text{Average Comparisons} = \frac{1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + n}{n}$$
    The sum of the first `n` integers is $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. Substituting this into the equation gives:
    $$\text{Average Comparisons} = \frac{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}{n} = \frac{n+1}{2}$$
* **Complexity**: The average number of comparisons is $\frac{n+1}{2}$. As `n` grows, this expression is still linearly dependent on `n`. Therefore, the average-case time complexity is **$O(n)$**.

### Summary

| Case | Input Data Condition | Time Complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Best Case** | Item is at the first position | $O(1)$ |
| **Average Case**| Item is at a random position | $O(n)$ |
| **Worst Case** | Item is at the last position or not found | $O(n)$ |
