| Aspect              | **Machine Learning (ML)**                               | **Traditional Programming (TP)**         | **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**                          | **Data Science (DS)**                                         |

| **Definition**      | System learns patterns from data automatically          | Rule-based: programmer defines all rules | Broad field creating systems with human-like intelligence | Extracts insights from structured & unstructured data         |
| **Input**           | Data + Output → Learns Rules (model)                    | Data + Rules → Output                    | Data, environment, and goals                              | Large, raw data (structured/unstructured)                     |
| **Focus**           | Prediction & learning                                   | Automating predefined tasks              | Reasoning, problem-solving, decision-making               | Cleaning, analyzing & visualizing data                        |
| **Adaptability**    | Adaptive, improves with data                            | Rigid, fails if unseen cases arise       | Adaptive + goal-oriented                                  | Insight-driven, adaptive with more data                       |
| **Techniques Used** | Regression, classification, clustering, neural networks | If–else, condition checks, loops         | Combines ML, NLP, robotics, expert systems                | Statistics, ML, visualization, big data tools                 |
| **Output**          | Predictive / probabilistic                              | Deterministic (same input → same output) | Intelligent behavior (speech, vision, planning)           | Actionable insights & decision support                        |
| **Transparency**    | Often low (black-box models like deep learning)         | High (rules explicitly coded & visible)  | Moderate to low (depends on system complexity)            | Moderate (results interpretable, but pipeline may be complex) |
| **Example**         | Spam detection, Netflix recommendations                 | Payroll system, Calculator program       | Self-driving car, Chatbot like Siri                       | Fraud detection, Business analytics                           |
| **Scope**           | Subset of AI                                            | Narrow, task-specific                    | Superset (AI includes ML & more)                          | Overlaps ML & AI, focused on extracting value from data       |
