## **Difference Between Learning Models**

| Feature / Type         | **Supervised Learning**                                          | **Unsupervised Learning**                         | **Semi-Supervised Learning**                     | **Reinforcement Learning**                               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Type**          | Labeled (features + target)                                      | Unlabeled (only features)                         | Few labeled + many unlabeled                     | No fixed dataset; learns by interacting with environment |
| **Goal**               | Predict output for new data                                      | Find hidden patterns or structure                 | Improve accuracy with minimal labeled data       | Learn optimal policy to maximize cumulative reward       |
| **Feedback**           | Direct (correct labels given)                                    | None (no correct output provided)                 | Partial (labels for some data only)              | Reward/Penalty signal from environment                   |
| **Tasks**              | Regression, Classification                                       | Clustering, Association, Dimensionality Reduction | Same as supervised tasks but with limited labels | Sequential decision-making, control problems             |
| **Algorithms**         | Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Neural Networks | K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA, DBSCAN     | Self-training, Co-training, Graph-based methods  | Q-Learning, SARSA, Deep Q-Networks                       |
| **Real-world Example** | Email spam detection, House price prediction                     | Customer segmentation, Topic modeling             | Medical diagnosis with few labeled cases         | Game-playing AI, Self-driving cars                       |
| **Data Requirement**   | Large amount of labeled data                                     | Large amount of unlabeled data                    | Small labeled + large unlabeled                  | Continuous interaction with environment                  |
| **Output**             | Predicted label/value                                            | Clusters, groups, reduced dimensions              | Predicted label/value with improved accuracy     | Optimal sequence of actions (policy)                     |
