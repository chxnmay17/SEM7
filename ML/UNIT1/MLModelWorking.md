## **Q: How Machine Learning Model Works? Explain Various Steps Involved.**

### **Definition**

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions **without explicit programming**.

---

### **Working Principle**

An ML model **learns** from a dataset using an algorithm, optimizes parameters to minimize error, and **generalizes** to make predictions on unseen data.

---

### **Steps Involved in Building an ML Model**

#### **1. Problem Definition**

* Identify objective (e.g., classify emails as spam/ham).
* Choose type of ML:

  * **Supervised** (with labeled data)
  * **Unsupervised** (pattern finding)
  * **Reinforcement** (learning by feedback)

---

#### **2. Data Collection**

* Gather relevant, representative data.
* Example: Customer purchase history, sensor readings.
* Sources: Databases, APIs, sensors, web scraping.

---

#### **3. Data Preprocessing**

* Handle missing values, outliers.
* Convert categorical to numerical (**one-hot encoding**).
* Normalize/standardize features.
* Example: Scaling height (cm) to 0–1 range.

---

#### **4. Splitting Dataset**

* **Training Set** (\~70-80%) – used to learn.
* **Test Set** (\~20-30%) – used to evaluate.
* Optional: **Validation Set** for tuning hyperparameters.

---

#### **5. Model Selection**

* Choose suitable algorithm:

  * Classification: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree.
  * Regression: Linear Regression.
  * Clustering: K-Means.

---

#### **6. Training the Model**

* Feed training data to the algorithm.
* Adjust internal parameters (weights) using **optimization** (e.g., Gradient Descent).
* Loss Function measures error (e.g., MSE for regression).

---

#### **7. Model Evaluation**

* Use **test data** to check performance.
* Metrics:

  * Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score (classification)
  * RMSE, MAE (regression)

---

#### **8. Hyperparameter Tuning**

* Adjust parameters like learning rate, tree depth.
* Methods: Grid Search, Random Search.

---

#### **9. Deployment**

* Integrate model into real-world applications.
* Example: Fraud detection system in a banking app.

---

#### **10. Monitoring & Maintenance**

* Track performance over time.
* Retrain when data distribution changes (**concept drift**).

✅ **Exam Tip:** For 7 marks – write **definition (1M)**, **steps with 1-2 lines each (5M)**, and **diagram/code/mnemonic (1M)** for full marks.

If you want, I can also make a **clear labeled diagram** showing all steps in a **flowchart style** so you can directly copy into your exam sheet. Would you like me to prepare that?
