## **Q: What is Machine Learning? Explain Applications of Machine Learning in Data Science**

---

### **1. Definition of Machine Learning**

* **Machine Learning (ML)** is a **subset of Artificial Intelligence** where computers learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions **without being explicitly programmed**.
* **Arthur Samuel (1959):** “Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.”

### **2. Relation with Data Science**

* **Data Science** involves extracting meaningful insights from data.
* **Machine Learning** is a **core tool** in Data Science to build predictive and prescriptive models from large datasets.

### **3. Applications of ML in Data Science**

#### **A. Predictive Analytics**

* Uses historical data to predict future events.
* **Example:** Predicting customer churn in telecom.

#### **B. Classification**

* Categorizing data into predefined classes.
* **Example:** Email spam vs non-spam detection.

#### **C. Clustering**

* Grouping similar data points without predefined labels.
* **Example:** Customer segmentation in marketing.

#### **D. Recommendation Systems**

* Suggesting items based on user behavior.
* **Example:** Netflix movie recommendations, Amazon product suggestions.

#### **E. Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

* Understanding and processing human language.
* **Example:** Sentiment analysis of tweets.

#### **F. Anomaly Detection**

* Identifying unusual patterns in data.
* **Example:** Fraud detection in credit card transactions.

#### **G. Time Series Forecasting**

* Predicting trends over time.
* **Example:** Stock price prediction, sales forecasting.

#### **H. Image and Video Analytics**

* Recognizing objects, faces, or activities from images/videos.
* **Example:** Medical image diagnosis.
