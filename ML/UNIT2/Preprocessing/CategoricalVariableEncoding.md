## **Why Categorical Variable Encoding is Needed**

**Definition:**
Categorical variables are features with **discrete, non-numeric values** (e.g., color, gender, country).
Most ML algorithms **cannot process raw categorical data**, as they work with numerical values.

**Need for Encoding:**

* Converts categories into a **numeric format** ML models can understand
* Prevents algorithms from assuming **ordinal relationships** between categories when not present
* Improves **model accuracy and interpretability**

**Examples of Categorical Variables:**

* **Nominal** (no order): Color = {Red, Blue, Green}
* **Ordinal** (ordered): Size = {Small, Medium, Large}

## **One-Hot Encoding**

**Definition:**
One-hot encoding converts each category into a **separate binary feature (0 or 1)**, representing the presence or absence of that category.

**Process:**

1. Identify categorical variable
2. Create a new binary column for **each category**
3. Mark `1` for the category present in the row, else `0`

---

**Example:**
Original Data:

| ID | Color |
| -- | ----- |
| 1  | Red   |
| 2  | Green |
| 3  | Blue  |

After One-Hot Encoding:

| ID | Color\_Red | Color\_Green | Color\_Blue |
| -- | ---------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| 1  | 1          | 0            | 0           |
| 2  | 0          | 1            | 0           |
| 3  | 0          | 0            | 1           |

**Diagram:**

```
Color (Red, Green, Blue)  →  [1,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,1]
```

---

**Advantages:**

* No assumption of ordinal relationship
* Suitable for nominal categorical variables
* Simple and widely supported (e.g., Pandas `get_dummies()`)

**Limitations:**

* Increases dimensionality if many categories (**curse of dimensionality**)
* Inefficient for high-cardinality features
