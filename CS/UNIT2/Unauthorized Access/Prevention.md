* Use **complex passwords** (mix of letters, numbers, symbols).
* Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** (e.g., password + OTP/biometrics).

### **2. Access Control Policies**

* Follow **Principle of Least Privilege (POLP)** – give users only required access.
* Role-based access control for sensitive systems.

### **3. Regular Updates & Patching**

* Keep OS, applications, and antivirus software updated to fix vulnerabilities.

### **4. Network Security Measures**

* Use **firewalls**, **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**.
* Encrypt data in transit (TLS/SSL).

### **5. User Awareness & Training**

* Educate employees about **phishing attacks** and safe login practices.
* Avoid clicking unknown links or sharing credentials.
