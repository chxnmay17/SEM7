# **Different Ways to Gain Access to a Computer System**

✅ In *Cyber Security*, gaining unauthorized access refers to intruders exploiting weaknesses in software, hardware, or user behavior to control or misuse a system.

---

### **1. Password Attacks**

* **Brute Force Attack**: Trying all possible combinations of passwords.
* **Dictionary Attack**: Using common wordlists.
* **Social Engineering/Phishing**: Tricking users into revealing passwords.
  *Example*: Fake login page for email accounts.

---

### **2. Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities**

* Attackers exploit bugs or unpatched systems.
* **Buffer overflow**, **SQL injection**, or **remote code execution**.
  *Example*: Exploiting outdated Windows services.

---

### **3. Malware Installation**

* Using **viruses, worms, Trojans, or keyloggers** to secretly control systems.
* Often delivered via email attachments or malicious websites.
  *Example*: Ransomware encrypting files after gaining access.

---

### **4. Network-Based Access**

* Sniffing or intercepting unencrypted communication.
* Exploiting weak Wi-Fi security (WEP/WPA cracking).
  *Example*: Accessing open Wi-Fi in public places.

---

### **5. Physical Access**

* Direct access to the machine (e.g., plugging in USB with malware).
* Stealing laptops or bypassing security via bootable devices.

### **Summary (for exam writing)**

* Attackers gain access through **password attacks, software vulnerabilities, malware, network exploitation, and physical access**.
* Strong authentication, regular patching, firewalls, and physical security reduce risks.
