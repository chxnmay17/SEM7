## **Hardware Protection**

* **Definition:**
  Hardware Protection refers to the security mechanisms used to safeguard the **physical components of a computer system** (CPU, memory, storage, I/O devices) from unauthorized access, misuse, or failures.
* Purpose: Ensure system reliability, prevent malicious activities, and maintain **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)**.

## **Types of Hardware Protection**

1. **Memory Protection**

   * Prevents one program from accessing memory allocated to another.
   * Implemented using base and limit registers, paging, or segmentation.

2. **CPU Protection**

   * Restricts unauthorized programs from gaining control of CPU.
   * Timer interrupts used to avoid infinite loops and resource hogging.

3. **I/O Protection**

   * Controls access to Input/Output devices through privileged instructions.
   * Example: Printer access restricted only to authorized processes.

4. **File/Storage Protection**

   * Ensures secure access to data stored on disk or secondary storage.
   * Achieved through access rights, encryption, and backup systems.

5. **Physical Hardware Protection**

   * Protection of actual devices against theft, tampering, or damage.
   * Example: Biometric locks, CCTV, restricted server room access.
