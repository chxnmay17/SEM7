## **Firewall and VPN Security Technologies**

### **1. Firewall (Network Gatekeeper)**

* **Definition**: A firewall is a security device (hardware/software) that monitors and controls incoming & outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules.
* **Significance**:

  * **Access Control** → Blocks unauthorized access, permits only trusted traffic.
  * **Packet Filtering** → Examines source/destination IP, port numbers.
  * **Intrusion Prevention** → Detects and blocks malicious traffic.
  * **Segmentation** → Separates internal network from external threats.

**Diagram:**

```
[Internet] ⇄ [Firewall] ⇄ [Internal Network]
```

**Example**: Blocking port 21 to prevent FTP attacks.

### **2. VPN (Virtual Private Network)**

* **Definition**: A VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel over the internet for safe communication.
* **Significance**:

  * **Confidentiality** → Encrypts data to prevent eavesdropping.
  * **Integrity** → Ensures data is not modified during transmission.
  * **Remote Access** → Allows employees to securely connect to corporate networks from outside.
  * **Anonymity** → Masks IP address, protects user identity.

**Diagram:**

```
[User Device] ⇄ (Encrypted Tunnel via VPN) ⇄ [Corporate Network]
```

**Example**: Employees working from home access company servers securely using VPN.

### **Conclusion**

* **Firewall** → Acts as the **first line of defense**, controlling traffic.
* **VPN** → Ensures **secure communication** over untrusted networks.
  Together, they provide a **layered security approach** in **Cyber Security**.
