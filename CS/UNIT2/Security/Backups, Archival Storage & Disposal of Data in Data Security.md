## **Backups, Archival Storage & Disposal of Data in Data Security**

### **1. Backups**

* **Definition:** Creating copies of important data to restore it in case of loss, corruption, or cyberattack.
* **Types:**

  * **Full Backup:** Entire dataset copied.
  * **Incremental Backup:** Only changes since the last backup.
  * **Differential Backup:** Changes since the last full backup.
* **Techniques:** Cloud storage, external drives, RAID systems.
* **Example:** Daily database backups in banking systems.

### **2. Archival Storage**

* **Definition:** Long-term storage of infrequently used data for legal, compliance, or historical purposes.
* **Features:**

  * Cheaper, slower storage (tapes, optical disks, cloud archives).
  * Data is rarely accessed but must be retained.
* **Uses:** Medical records, financial statements, government data retention.
* **Example:** A university storing old student records for 10+ years.

### **3. Disposal of Data**

* **Definition:** Secure and permanent removal of data that is no longer needed.
* **Methods:**

  * **Data Wiping/Overwriting:** Rewriting storage media with random data.
  * **Degaussing:** Using magnetic fields to erase data on magnetic media.
  * **Physical Destruction:** Shredding or melting disks and drives.
* **Goal:** Prevent unauthorized recovery of sensitive information.
* **Example:** Shredding hard drives used in government offices.
