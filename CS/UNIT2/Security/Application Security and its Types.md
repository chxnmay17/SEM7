## **Application Security**

* **Definition:**
  Application Security refers to the practice of protecting software applications from threats, vulnerabilities, and unauthorized access throughout their development and usage.
* Goal: Ensure **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)** of application data and services.
* Example: Using input validation to prevent **SQL Injection**.

---

## **Types of Application Security**

1. **Authentication Security**

   * Verifying user identity (e.g., passwords, biometrics, MFA).

2. **Authorization Security**

   * Ensuring users have access only to permitted resources (Role-Based Access Control).

3. **Data Security**

   * Protecting data in storage and transit (encryption, hashing).

4. **Input Validation & Error Handling**

   * Preventing attacks like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

5. **Session Management Security**

   * Secure cookies, session timeouts to prevent hijacking.

6. **Configuration & Patch Management**

   * Regular updates, secure default settings, vulnerability patching.

## **Types of Application Security**

1. **Database Security**

   * Protecting stored data from unauthorized access, leakage, or modification.
   * Techniques:

     * Access control, encryption, backups.
     * Preventing **SQL Injection** attacks.
   * Example: Using parameterized queries in SQL.

2. **E-mail Security**

   * Protecting email communication from phishing, spam, and malware.
   * Techniques:

     * Spam filters, digital signatures, encryption (PGP, S/MIME).
     * Multi-factor authentication for email accounts.
   * Example: Gmail blocking phishing emails.

3. **Internet Security**

   * Securing web-based applications and browsing activities.
   * Techniques:

     * Firewalls, SSL/TLS encryption, anti-malware tools.
     * Protection against threats like phishing sites and DDoS.
   * Example: HTTPS ensuring secure communication between browser and website.
