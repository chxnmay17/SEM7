## **Operating System (OS) Security**

* **Definition:**
  OS Security refers to the set of measures and mechanisms implemented by an operating system to **protect data, resources, and services** from unauthorized access, misuse, and attacks.

## **Key Features of OS Security**

1. **User Authentication**

   * Verifies user identity using passwords, biometrics, or multi-factor authentication.

2. **Access Control**

   * Enforces file permissions and user privileges (Read/Write/Execute).
   * Implements **Principle of Least Privilege (POLP)**.

3. **Memory & Process Protection**

   * Ensures isolation between processes.
   * Prevents one program from interfering with another’s memory.

4. **File System Security**

   * Provides encryption and access restrictions to protect stored data.

5. **Audit & Logging**

   * Maintains activity logs to detect and investigate suspicious behavior.

6. **Patch Management & Updates**

   * Regular updates fix vulnerabilities and strengthen security.

✅ **Exam Tip (5 marks):**

* Define OS security in 1–2 lines.
* Write 4–5 mechanisms briefly.
* Add a **simple diagram** → full marks.
