## **Computer Intrusion**

* **Definition:**
  Computer intrusion is any unauthorized activity or access to a computer system, network, or application with the intent to steal, damage, or disrupt services.

### **Types of Computer Intrusion**

1. **Virus Attack** – Malicious code that attaches to programs/files and spreads when executed.
2. **Worms** – Self-replicating programs spreading automatically over networks.
3. **Trojan Horse** – Malicious program disguised as useful software.
4. **Spyware** – Software secretly monitoring user activity.
5. **Adware** – Displays unwanted ads, often bundled with free software.
6. **Rootkits** – Tools that hide malicious processes or files to maintain privileged access.
7. **Backdoors/Trapdoors** – Hidden entry points bypassing authentication.
8. **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)** – Flooding a system/network to make it unavailable.

## **Difference between Virus & Worms**

| **Aspect**        | **Virus**                                                              | **Worm**                                                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**    | Malicious code that attaches to files/programs and executes with them. | Self-replicating malware spreading independently via networks. |
| **Spread Method** | Needs a host program or human action (e.g., opening a file).           | Spreads automatically without user intervention.               |
| **Damage**        | Corrupts files, deletes data, slows down system.                       | Consumes bandwidth, overloads systems, causes DoS.             |
| **Replication**   | Cannot replicate on its own.                                           | Replicates itself across systems/networks.                     |
| **Example**       | Melissa Virus, ILOVEYOU.                                               | Conficker, SQL Slammer Worm.                                   |

✅ **Exam Tip (8 marks):**

* Start with definition of **computer intrusion**.
* List **6–7 types with 1 line each**.
* Draw virus vs worm comparison table.
* Add small diagram for neatness → ensures full marks.
