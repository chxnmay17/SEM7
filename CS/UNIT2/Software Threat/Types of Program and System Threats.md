## **Program Threats**

* **Definition:** Malicious programs inserted into software to disrupt execution, steal data, or damage systems.

### **Types:**

1. **Trojan Horse** – Malicious code hidden inside a useful program.
   *Example: Fake software installer containing malware.*
2. **Trapdoor/Backdoor** – Hidden entry point bypassing normal authentication.
3. **Logic Bomb** – Code that triggers malicious action when a condition is met.
   *Example: Deleting files on a specific date.*
4. **Virus** – Attaches to files/programs, spreads when executed.
5. **Worms** – Self-replicating programs spreading across networks.

## **System Threats**

* **Definition:** Threats targeting the functioning of an entire system or network to disrupt services or gain control.

### **Types:**

1. **Denial of Service (DoS)** – Flooding system with traffic to make it unavailable.
2. **Distributed DoS (DDoS)** – Multiple compromised systems attack a target.
3. **Spoofing** – Masquerading as another user/system (IP or email spoofing).
4. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** – Attacker intercepts and alters communication.
5. **Ransomware** – Locks/encrypts system files demanding ransom for release.

## **Diagram (Classification of Threats)**

```
              [ Security Threats ]
                 /          \
        [ Program Threats ]   [ System Threats ]
       (Virus, Worms, etc.)  (DoS, Spoofing, etc.)
```

✅ **Exam Tip:** Start with definitions → write 3–4 program threats + 3–4 system threats (short points + examples) → add classification diagram → guaranteed full marks.
