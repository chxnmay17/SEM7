## **Internet Hacking & Cracking**

* **Hacking:**

  * Unauthorized access to computer systems or networks through the internet.
  * Can be **ethical** (to find vulnerabilities) or **malicious** (to steal or damage data).
  * Example: A hacker exploiting a website vulnerability to access its database.

* **Cracking:**

  * A subset of hacking, focused on **breaking security systems** for illegal purposes.
  * Always malicious in intent.
  * Example: Cracking passwords, pirated software, or license keys.

## **Types of Cracking**

1. **Password Cracking**

   * Breaking or guessing user passwords to gain unauthorized access.
   * Techniques: brute force, dictionary attack, rainbow tables.
   * Example: Cracking an email account password.

2. **Software Cracking**

   * Modifying or removing software protections to use without proper license.
   * Example: Pirated applications and games.

3. **Network Cracking**

   * Attacking network protocols (Wi-Fi, TCP/IP) to gain unauthorized access.
   * Example: Cracking WPA2 Wi-Fi password.

4. **Email Cracking**

   * Breaking into email accounts for data theft or spamming.
   * Example: Using phishing + password cracking to access Gmail.

5. **Website Cracking**

   * Exploiting web application vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS) to deface or control websites.

6. **Cryptographic Key Cracking**

   * Breaking encryption keys by brute force or mathematical attacks.
   * Example: Cracking RSA or DES encryption.

✅ **Exam Tip:**

* Write **definition of hacking & cracking (with difference)** (2–3 lines each).
* Mention **5–6 types of cracking with examples**.
* Add a small classification diagram.
* This structure easily scores full **8 marks**.
