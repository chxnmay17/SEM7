# **Need for Information Security**

### **Definition**

Information Security (InfoSec) = protecting **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)** of data from unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction.

---

### **Why is Information Security Needed?**

1. **Protect Confidential Data**

   * Prevent leakage of sensitive information (e.g., financial records, passwords, personal data).
   * Example: Data breaches in banks exposing customer account details.

2. **Maintain Data Integrity**

   * Ensure information is accurate and not tampered with.
   * Example: Unauthorized changes to medical records can endanger patients.

3. **Ensure Availability of Services**

   * Protect against DoS/DDoS attacks that disrupt services.
   * Example: E-commerce websites must stay online during peak sales.

4. **Prevent Financial & Reputational Loss**

   * Cyberattacks can cause monetary loss, legal penalties, and harm to brand image.
   * Example: Ransomware attacks demanding huge payouts.

5. **Compliance with Laws & Regulations**

   * Organizations must follow standards like GDPR, HIPAA, IT Act (India).
   * Failure leads to fines and legal consequences.

* **Impact**:

  * Huge financial losses (≈ \$4 billion).
  * Reputational damage to Equifax.
  * Legal penalties & lawsuits under data protection laws.

**Lesson Learned**: Strong **information security** (patch management, encryption, regular audits) is critical to prevent massive breaches.
