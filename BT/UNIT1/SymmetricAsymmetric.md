| **Aspect**            | **Symmetric Key Cryptography**                          | **Asymmetric Key Cryptography**                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Number of Keys**    | Single key used for both encryption & decryption        | Two keys: Public (encryption) & Private (decryption) |
| **Speed**             | Faster (lightweight computation)                        | Slower (complex mathematical operations)             |
| **Security**          | Less secure (key distribution problem)                  | More secure (no need to share private key)           |
| **Key Management**    | Difficult for many users (each pair needs a secret key) | Easier, as only public keys are shared               |
| **Algorithms**        | DES, AES, RC4                                           | RSA, ECC                                             |
| **Applications**      | File encryption, bulk data transfer                     | Blockchain, digital signatures, SSL/TLS              |
| **Scalability**       | Poor scalability (keys grow exponentially with users)   | Highly scalable (each user only needs one key pair)  |
| **Use in Blockchain** | Rarely used (inefficient for trustless networks)        | Widely used (wallets, transactions, consensus)       |
