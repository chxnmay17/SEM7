# ✦ Features of Blockchain

## ✅ Key Features

1. **Decentralization**

   * No single central authority; data is shared across all nodes.
   * Example: Bitcoin network operates without a central bank.

2. **Immutability**

   * Once data is recorded in a block, it cannot be altered or deleted.
   * Ensures **trust** in transaction history.

3. **Transparency**

   * All participants can view and verify transactions.
   * Builds accountability in systems like supply chain tracking.

4. **Security (Cryptographic Protection)**

   * Transactions are secured using **hashing** and **digital signatures**.
   * Reduces risks of fraud and unauthorized tampering.

5. **Consensus Mechanism**

   * Ensures agreement on the validity of transactions.
   * Example: **Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS)**.

6. **Traceability**

   * Every transaction is recorded and linked to previous ones.
   * Useful in industries like healthcare and food supply chains.

7. **Programmability (Smart Contracts)**

   * Blockchain supports **self-executing contracts**.
   * Example: Ethereum enables automatic execution of rules without intermediaries.
