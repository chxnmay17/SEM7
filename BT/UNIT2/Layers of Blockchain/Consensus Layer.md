# **Consensus Layer in Blockchain**

### **Definition**

* The **consensus layer** is the core component of blockchain architecture responsible for ensuring that all nodes in the network **agree on the state of the ledger**.
* It prevents issues like **double-spending** and ensures **trust** without a central authority.

---

### **Functions**

* **Agreement:** Ensures all nodes maintain a consistent copy of the blockchain.
* **Validation:** Confirms transactions are legitimate before adding blocks.
* **Fault Tolerance:** Handles malicious or faulty nodes.
* **Security:** Protects against attacks (e.g., 51% attack).

---

### **Popular Consensus Mechanisms**

1. **Proof of Work (PoW):**

   * Nodes (miners) solve complex puzzles.
   * Example: Bitcoin.
   * High security but energy-intensive.

2. **Proof of Stake (PoS):**

   * Validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency staked.
   * Example: Ethereum 2.0.
   * Energy-efficient compared to PoW.

3. **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT):**

   * Nodes reach agreement even if some act maliciously.
   * Used in permissioned blockchains (e.g., Hyperledger).

### **Diagram (Simple Flow)**

```
[Transaction Created]  
       ↓  
[Consensus Layer → Validation + Agreement]  
       ↓  
[Block Added to Blockchain]  
```

### **Real-World Example**

* In **Bitcoin**, PoW ensures that once a block is mined, the majority of nodes agree it is valid → thus preventing double-spending.
* In **Ethereum 2.0**, PoS allows faster and greener consensus by validator selection.

---

### **Summary (Exam Tip)**

* Consensus layer = “**Rulebook of agreement in blockchain**.”
* Maintains **integrity, trust, and security** in a decentralized network.
* Different mechanisms (PoW, PoS, PBFT) balance **security, scalability, and energy efficiency**.
