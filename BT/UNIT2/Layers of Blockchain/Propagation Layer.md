# **Propagation Layer in Blockchain**

### **Definition**

* The **propagation layer** is the communication layer of blockchain that ensures **transactions and blocks are broadcast across all nodes** in the network.
* It uses **peer-to-peer (P2P) networking** to keep every node updated with the latest data.

---

### **Functions**

* **Transaction Broadcasting:** Newly created transactions are propagated to all nodes.
* **Block Broadcasting:** Newly mined/validated blocks are shared across the network.
* **Network Synchronization:** Ensures all nodes maintain the **same, updated copy** of the ledger.
* **Fault Tolerance:** Even if some nodes are offline, others continue sharing data → reliability.

---

### **Working**

1. User initiates a transaction.
2. Transaction is broadcast to nearby nodes.
3. Nodes validate and forward it further (gossip protocol).
4. Once validated in a block, the block is also propagated to all nodes.
5. Network reaches **consistency** in data.

### **Diagram**

```
 [User Transaction]  
        ↓  
   [Node A] → Broadcast → [Node B]  
       ↓                     ↓  
   [Node C] ← Broadcast ← [Node D]  
 
→ Data spreads until all nodes are updated
```

### **Real-World Example**

* In **Bitcoin**, when a miner solves a block, it is immediately **propagated** to the entire network so that all nodes update their blockchain copy.

---

### **Summary (Exam Tip)**

* The **propagation layer** is the **communication backbone** of blockchain.
* Ensures **transactions and blocks spread quickly and reliably**, maintaining **synchronization and trust** in a decentralized network.
