# **Execution Layer in Blockchain**

### **Definition**

* The **execution layer** is the part of blockchain architecture where **transactions and smart contracts are executed**.
* It defines **rules, logic, and computation** that determine how data is processed once consensus is reached.

---

### **Functions**

* **Transaction Execution:** Executes user-submitted transactions after validation.
* **Smart Contract Processing:** Runs decentralized applications (DApps) logic.
* **State Management:** Updates blockchain state (balances, ownership, records).
* **Interface for Developers:** Provides programming frameworks (e.g., Solidity in Ethereum).

---

### **Working**

1. User submits a transaction or triggers a smart contract.
2. **Consensus Layer** validates transaction.
3. Execution layer **runs the code/logic** (e.g., transfer tokens, verify conditions).
4. Updated results (new state) are recorded in the blockchain.

### **Diagram**

```
 [User Transaction / Smart Contract Call]
                  ↓
        [Consensus Layer → Validation]
                  ↓
        [Execution Layer → Runs Logic]
                  ↓
       [Blockchain State Updated in Data Layer]
```

### **Real-World Examples**

* **Ethereum Execution Layer (EVM):** Executes smart contracts written in Solidity.
* **Bitcoin Script:** Executes simple transaction validation logic.

---

### **Summary (Exam Tip)**

* The **execution layer** = the **“logic layer”** of blockchain.
* It ensures **transactions and smart contracts are executed correctly**, updating the blockchain state securely.
