# **Limitations of Centralized System (w\.r.t Decentralized System)**

### **Definition Context**

* **Centralized System:** Single authority/server manages all data and decisions.
* **Decentralized System:** Multiple nodes share control → more secure and transparent.

---

### **Limitations of Centralized System**

1. **Single Point of Failure**

   * If central server crashes or is attacked → whole system fails.
   * Decentralized networks remain functional even if some nodes fail.

2. **Lack of Transparency**

   * Users must trust central authority.
   * Decentralized systems allow all participants to verify transactions.

3. **Security Risks**

   * Central servers are prime targets for hacking, data breaches.
   * Decentralization distributes data → harder to tamper.

4. **Censorship & Control**

   * Authority can manipulate, block, or delete data.
   * In decentralized systems, no single party controls data.

5. **Limited Trust**

   * Users rely on trust in the central authority.
   * In decentralized systems, consensus mechanisms ensure trustless operation.

6. **Scalability Bottleneck**

   * Processing power and storage limited to central server.
   * In decentralized systems, workload is distributed among nodes.

### **Diagram**

```
Centralized System:                  Decentralized System:

      [Central Server]                     [Node]---[Node]
        /   |   \                         /   |   \   | 
     User  User  User              [Node]---[Node]---[Node]

→ If server fails → system fails     → Even if some nodes fail → system works
```

### **Real-World Examples**

* **Centralized:** Banking system – if bank server is down, transactions stop.
* **Decentralized:** Bitcoin – continues to operate even if some nodes go offline.

---

### **Summary (Exam Tip)**

* Centralized systems suffer from **failure, security, trust, and transparency issues**.
* Decentralized systems overcome these by **distributing control, ensuring security, and improving reliability**.
