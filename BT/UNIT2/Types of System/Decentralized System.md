# **Decentralized System**

### **Definition**

* A **decentralized system** is one where **control, data, and decision-making are distributed across multiple nodes** instead of relying on a single central authority.
* Each node has a **copy of the data** and can participate in validation and decision-making.

---

### **Characteristics**

* **No Single Point of Failure:** If one node fails, the system continues to work.
* **Transparency:** Data and transactions are visible to all participants.
* **Trustless:** No need to rely on a central authority; consensus ensures validity.
* **Security:** Harder to hack as data is distributed across many nodes.
* **Scalability Challenge:** Coordination takes longer due to consensus mechanisms.

### **Working of a Decentralized System (in Blockchain Context)**

1. **Transaction Initiation** – A user submits a transaction (e.g., sending cryptocurrency).
2. **Broadcasting** – The transaction is shared with all nodes in the network.
3. **Validation** – Nodes independently verify the transaction (e.g., digital signature, balance check).
4. **Consensus Mechanism** – Nodes agree on the validity using algorithms like **Proof of Work (PoW)** or **Proof of Stake (PoS)**.
5. **Block Creation** – Validated transactions are grouped into a block.
6. **Block Addition** – The block is added to the blockchain; all nodes update their copies.
7. **Result** – Transaction becomes permanent, transparent, and tamper-resistant.

Centralized System:          Decentralized System:

      [Central Server]             [Node]   [Node]
        /   |   \                  /   \   /   \
    User  User  User        [Node]---[Node]---[Node]
                                   \    |    /
                                    [Node]
```

### **Real-World Examples**

* **Bitcoin / Ethereum Blockchain:** Transactions validated by multiple nodes.
* **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks:** e.g., BitTorrent, where files are shared directly among users.

---

### **Summary (Exam Tip)**

* A **decentralized system** distributes control across nodes → ensuring **security, transparency, and reliability**.
* Widely used in **blockchain networks** to eliminate central authority and build **trustless environments**.
