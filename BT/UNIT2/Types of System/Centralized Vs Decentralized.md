# **Centralized vs. Decentralized System**

### **Definition**

* **Centralized System:**

  * A single authority/server controls data and decision-making.
  * Example: Banking system, Facebook.

* **Decentralized System:**

  * Multiple nodes share control; no single authority.
  * Example: Bitcoin, Ethereum.

### **Key Differences**

| Aspect               | Centralized System                      | Decentralized System                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Control**          | Single authority manages the system     | Shared control across multiple nodes   |
| **Point of Failure** | Single point of failure (vulnerable)    | No single point of failure (resilient) |
| **Transparency**     | Low → users trust central authority     | High → transactions visible on ledger  |
| **Security**         | More prone to hacking at central server | More secure as data is distributed     |
| **Speed**            | Faster decision-making                  | Slower due to consensus among nodes    |
| **Examples**         | Banks, Google, Social Media             | Blockchain, Bitcoin, Ethereum          |

### **Diagram**

```
Centralized System:                 Decentralized System:

      [Central Server]                   [Node]   [Node]
        /   |   \                        /   \   /   \
    User  User  User               [Node]---[Node]---[Node]
                                        \    |    /
                                         [Node]
```

### **Real-World Analogy**

* **Centralized:** Like a **library** with one librarian; if librarian is absent, system stops.
* **Decentralized:** Like a **peer-to-peer file sharing** system; even if some nodes fail, data is still available.

---

### **Summary (Exam Tip)**

* Centralized → **Efficiency but weak trust & single point of failure**.
* Decentralized → **Trustless, secure, transparent but slower**.
* Blockchain belongs to **decentralized systems**.
