# **Difference between Testing and Debugging**

| **Aspect**       | **Testing**                                               | **Debugging**                                                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**   | Process of executing software to **find defects**.        | Process of analyzing and modifying code to **fix defects**.        |
| **Performed By** | **Testers / QA team**                                     | **Developers / Programmers**                                       |
| **Objective**    | To check if software behaves as expected.                 | To identify the root cause of defect and correct it.               |
| **Timing**       | Done **after coding**, before release.                    | Done **after a defect is reported** during testing.                |
| **Focus**        | System behavior and functionality.                        | Code logic and error correction.                                   |
| **Output**       | Defect/bug reports.                                       | Fixed code, updated build.                                         |
| **Example**      | Tester finds that “login fails with correct credentials.” | Developer analyzes code, finds database query error, and fixes it. |

### **Simple Flow Diagram (Exam-style)**

```
Coding → Testing (find defect) → Debugging (fix defect) → Retesting
```

✅ **Exam Tip:**

* Always give **at least 4–5 comparison points** in a neat table.
* Add a **small diagram/flow** for bonus clarity.
* Use a **real-world example** (like login or payment failure).
