# **Comparison between Tools and Techniques**

ðŸ‘‰ In Software Testing, both **tools** and **techniques** are used, but they differ in purpose and usage.

---

### **Definition**

* **Tools:** Software applications that **automate or support** the testing process.
* **Techniques:** **Methods/approaches** used to design and execute test cases.

### **Comparison Table**

| **Aspect**     | **Tools**                                                            | **Techniques**                                                                           |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | Software applications used to perform or support testing activities. | Logical methods/approaches used to carry out testing.                                    |
| **Nature**     | Technology-based (require installation/software).                    | Knowledge-based (require testerâ€™s skill and understanding).                              |
| **Purpose**    | Automate, speed up, and manage testing process.                      | Identify, design, and execute test cases effectively.                                    |
| **Examples**   | Selenium, JUnit, LoadRunner, QTP.                                    | Black-box testing, White-box testing, Boundary value analysis, Equivalence partitioning. |
| **Dependency** | Depend on infrastructure, licenses, and resources.                   | Depend on testerâ€™s expertise and systematic approach.                                    |
| **Output**     | Automated execution reports, logs, and metrics.                      | Test cases, test conditions, defect detection.                                           |

### **Diagram (Exam-style)**

```
          Tools  â†’  Automation (e.g., Selenium)
Testing
          Techniques â†’  Methods (e.g., BVA, Black-box)
```

---

### **Key Point**

* **Tools** = *"What we use"* (automation support).
* **Techniques** = *"How we test"* (methodology).
* Both complement each other in achieving **software quality assurance**.

---

âœ… **Exam Tip:**

* Always answer with a **comparison table (4â€“5 points minimum)**.
* Add **examples of each** (very scoring).
* Use a **small diagram** for extra clarity.
