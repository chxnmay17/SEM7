# **PDCA Cycle (Deming Cycle)**

üëâ The **PDCA cycle** is a **continuous improvement model** used in **quality management** and **software testing** to ensure systematic problem solving and process improvement.

---

### **Phases of PDCA Cycle**

1. **Plan**

   * Identify problem or area for improvement.
   * Define objectives, resources, and processes.
   * *Example:* Plan a new **test strategy** for an e-commerce website to improve defect detection.

2. **Do**

   * Implement the planned process on a small scale.
   * Execute tasks and collect data.
   * *Example:* Execute **test cases** in a pilot module (e.g., login system).

3. **Check**

   * Monitor and evaluate results.
   * Compare actual outcomes with expected results.
   * *Example:* Analyze number of **defects found vs. expected**, measure test coverage.

4. **Act**

   * Standardize the successful process or take corrective action.
   * Apply improvements for continuous quality enhancement.
   * *Example:* If login testing was effective, **apply same strategy** across all modules.

### **Key Point**

* PDCA ensures **continuous improvement** in software quality.
* It is widely applied in **Software Testing & QA** for defect prevention and process optimization.

‚úÖ **Exam Tip:**

* Write **4 steps clearly with one-line explanation each**.
* Always **draw the cycle diagram** (circle or arrows).
* Add **one real-world example** (like login testing or bug fixing).
