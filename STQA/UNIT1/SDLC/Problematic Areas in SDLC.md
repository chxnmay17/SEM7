# **Problematic Areas in SDLC**

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) provides a structured process, but several issues arise that affect **quality, cost, and timely delivery** of software.

---

### **1. Requirement Issues**

* Ambiguous, incomplete, or frequently changing requirements.
* Miscommunication between stakeholders and developers.
* *Example*: In an e-commerce app, unclear requirements for “return/refund policy” cause redesign later.

---

### **2. Design Problems**

* Poor system architecture leading to scalability or integration issues.
* Overlooking non-functional aspects (security, performance, usability).
* *Example*: Payment gateway not considered in design → costly rework.

---

### **3. Development Challenges**

* Delays due to underestimated complexity.
* Lack of coding standards or improper documentation.
* Dependency on outdated technologies.

---

### **4. Testing Constraints**

* Inadequate test planning or insufficient test coverage.
* Time crunch → testing is rushed, leading to undetected defects.
* *Example*: Application crashes under high load not detected during limited testing.

---

### **5. Deployment & Maintenance Issues**

* Errors during deployment (version mismatch, configuration problems).
* High cost of post-release bug fixes.
* Frequent change requests increase maintenance overhead.

### **Diagram (Exam-style)**

```
Requirement → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
        ^         |          |          |          | 
        |         |          |          |          |
   Problematic if unclear / poor / incomplete in each phase
```

✅ **Exam Tip:**

* Use **short bullets** + **one real-world example**.
* Cover **all phases briefly**.
* Keep diagram **simple and labeled** to secure full marks.
