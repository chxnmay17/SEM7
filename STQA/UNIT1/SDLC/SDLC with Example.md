# **SDLC for Online Food Delivery Application (Agile Model)**

---

### **1. Requirement Gathering**

* Collect requirements from stakeholders:

  * **Customers** → order food, track delivery, make payments.
  * **Restaurants** → manage menu, accept/reject orders.
  * **Delivery partners** → receive delivery requests, navigation support.
* Define both **functional requirements** (order placement, payment) and **non-functional requirements** (scalability, security, performance).

---

### **2. Design the Requirements**

* Convert requirements into **system architecture & design**.
* Prepare:

  * **High-level design** (overall modules: User App, Restaurant App, Delivery Partner App, Admin Panel).
  * **Detailed design** (database schema, APIs, UI/UX mockups).
* Ensure proper modularity for scalability and easy maintenance.

---

### **3. Construction / Iteration**

* Actual coding and development, done in small **iterations/sprints**.
* Example breakdown:

  * Sprint 1 → Login & Signup module.
  * Sprint 2 → Menu display & order placement.
  * Sprint 3 → Payment integration & delivery tracking.
* Uses technologies like mobile app frameworks, backend services, and databases.

---

### **4. Testing / Quality Assurance**

* Application is tested to ensure correctness and reliability.
* Activities include:

  * **Functional testing** → Check ordering workflow, payment, delivery.
  * **Integration testing** → Verify smooth working across modules (e.g., restaurant + delivery + payment).
  * **Performance testing** → Handle high load during peak hours.
  * **Security testing** → Protect sensitive user and payment data.

---

### **5. Deployment**

* Deploy the application to production.
* **Staged deployment** may be used:

  * Beta release in one city.
  * Gradual rollout across multiple regions.
* Available on **Android/iOS app stores** and monitored after launch.

---

### **6. Feedback**

* Collect user and stakeholder feedback to improve the system.
* Examples:

  * Adding new features like “contactless delivery.”
  * Fixing bugs or enhancing UI.
* Feedback becomes input for the **next requirement cycle**, ensuring continuous improvement.

### **Diagram (Exam-style)**

```
Requirement → Design → Construction → Testing → Deployment → Feedback → (loops back to Requirement)
```

✅ **Exam Tip:**

* Stick to **6 phases clearly explained with examples**.
* Always use a **real-life application** (Food Delivery, Banking, or E-commerce).
* Draw the **simple flow diagram** to secure full marks.
