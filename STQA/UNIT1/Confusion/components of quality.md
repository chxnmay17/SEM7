## üìò *Define Software Quality. List & Explain Core Components of Quality*

**Subject:** *Software Testing and Quality Assurance*
**Marks:** 5

---

### ‚úÖ **Definition of Software Quality:**

> **Software Quality** refers to the **degree to which a software product meets specified requirements**, **customer expectations**, and is **free of defects**.

* It includes both **functional correctness** and **non-functional attributes** (e.g., performance, usability).
* Quality ensures the software is **reliable, maintainable, efficient, and usable**.

---

### üîë **Core Components of Software Quality:**

Based on **ISO 9126 / ISO 25010** standards, core components (also called **quality attributes**) include:

---

#### 1. **Functionality**

‚úî *What the system does.*

* Software must perform the tasks it is intended to do.
* Includes correctness, compliance, and security.
* üìå *Example:* Banking app correctly calculates interest.

---

#### 2. **Reliability**

‚úî *Stability of software under specific conditions.*

* Ability to function under predefined conditions for a defined time.
* Includes fault tolerance and recoverability.
* üìå *Example:* ATM software continues working despite network delays.

---

#### 3. **Usability**

‚úî *Ease of use for end users.*

* User-friendly interface, help features, and accessibility.
* üìå *Example:* Mobile apps with intuitive navigation and clear icons.

---

#### 4. **Efficiency**

‚úî *Resource usage vs. performance.*

* Optimal use of CPU, memory, network with minimal delays.
* üìå *Example:* A video editing tool using minimal RAM without lag.

---

#### 5. **Maintainability**

‚úî *Ease of making changes or fixing bugs.*

* Modular code, proper documentation, and simple architecture.
* üìå *Example:* Updating features in a large web application easily.

---

#### 6. **Portability**

‚úî *Software‚Äôs adaptability across environments.*

* Ability to run on various platforms with minimal modification.
* üìå *Example:* A game runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

# **Software Quality**

üëâ **Definition:**
Software Quality is the **degree to which software meets customer requirements, performs reliably, and is free from defects**, while being maintainable and cost-effective.
*(‚ÄúConformance to requirements and fitness for use‚Äù ‚Äì Crosby & Juran)*

---

# **Core Components of Software Quality**

### **1. Quality of Design**

* Refers to how well the software is **conceptualized and designed**.
* Includes requirement clarity, architecture, UI/UX design, and database structure.
* *Example:* Designing a food delivery app with proper modules (User App, Restaurant App, Delivery App).

---

### **2. Quality of Conformance**

* Refers to how well the **implementation matches the design specifications**.
* Depends on coding standards, testing, reviews, and defect control.
* *Example:* Developer writes code strictly as per login module design, without deviations.

---

### **3. Quality of Performance (User Perspective)**

* Refers to how well the delivered software **meets customer expectations in real use**.
* Includes reliability, usability, efficiency, and security.
* *Example:* The food delivery app runs fast, processes payments securely, and does not crash under heavy load.

   +----------------+-----------------+------------------+
   | Quality of     | Quality of      | Quality of       |
   | Design         | Conformance     | Performance      |
```

‚úÖ **Exam Tip:**

* Write **definition first** + **3 components explained briefly**.
* Use **real-world example** for clarity.
* Add a **simple diagram/box format** to secure full marks.
