# Pillars of Quality Management System (QMS)

**Definition:**
A **Quality Management System (QMS)** is a structured framework of **policies, processes, and procedures** used to ensure that a software product consistently meets **customer and regulatory requirements**.
Its foundation rests on a few key **pillars**.

---

## Main Pillars of QMS

1. **Customer Focus**

   * Quality is defined by **customer satisfaction**.
   * Example: In software, frequent updates based on user feedback improve usability.

2. **Leadership**

   * Strong leadership sets **vision, direction, and commitment to quality**.
   * Example: Project manager enforces coding standards and quality reviews.

3. **People Involvement**

   * Quality is everyone’s responsibility.
   * Encourages **teamwork, training, and ownership** of tasks.

4. **Process Approach**

   * Focus on **well-defined processes**, not just end results.
   * Example: Following SDLC models (Agile, Waterfall) ensures systematic development and testing.

5. **Continuous Improvement**

   * Ongoing effort to enhance processes, products, and services.
   * Tools: **PDCA cycle (Plan–Do–Check–Act)**, root cause analysis.

6. **Evidence-Based Decision Making**

   * Decisions should rely on **data and metrics** (defect density, test coverage, reliability).
   * Avoids guesswork.

7. **Relationship Management**

   * Maintain strong relations with **stakeholders, vendors, and customers** for long-term success.

## Real-World Example (Software Context)

* In an **ERP attendance system**, QMS ensures:

  * Customer feedback → improved reporting formats.
  * Leadership → mandates testing before release.
  * Continuous improvement → bug fixes & feature updates.
