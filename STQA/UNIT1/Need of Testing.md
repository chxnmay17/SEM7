# Need of Testing

**Definition:**
Software testing is the process of **verifying and validating** that a software product works as intended, is free from defects, and meets customer requirements.

---

## Why Testing is Needed

1. **Defect Detection**

   * Identifies bugs/errors early before deployment.
   * Example: Detecting login failures in a college ERP before release.

2. **Quality Assurance**

   * Ensures the product meets **functional and non-functional requirements** (usability, reliability, performance).

3. **Customer Satisfaction**

   * Reliable, bug-free software builds **trust and satisfaction**.

4. **Cost and Time Saving**

   * Fixing defects in early stages (unit testing) is cheaper than fixing after release.

5. **Risk Reduction**

   * Prevents failures that may cause **financial, security, or safety risks**.
   * Example: Testing banking or space research software avoids critical losses.

## Diagram (Simple Flow)

```
[ Testing ] → [ Defect Detection ] → [ Quality Product ] → [ Customer Satisfaction ]
```

## Real-World Example

* **NASA Mars Climate Orbiter failure (1999):** A unit mismatch bug led to mission loss → highlights **why testing is essential**.
* **College Attendance Software:** Testing prevents duplicate/missing attendance records.

✅ **Key Point for Exams:**
Testing is needed to **detect defects, ensure quality, improve customer satisfaction, reduce cost, and minimize risks**, making it a **critical step in software development**.
