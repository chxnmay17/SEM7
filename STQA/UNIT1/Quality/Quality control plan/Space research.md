# Planning Software Quality Control with Respect to Space Research

### **Definition**

* **Software Quality Control (SQC):** A set of activities focused on monitoring processes and testing software to ensure it meets **quality standards**.
* In **space research**, where missions are **high-cost, high-risk, and mission-critical**, software must be **error-free, reliable, and fault-tolerant**, since **failure can cause loss of mission worth billions**.

---

### **Steps in Planning SQC for Space Research**

1. **Requirement Analysis & Validation**

   * Requirements must be **precisely defined, validated, and traceable**.
   * No ambiguity (e.g., response time, fault tolerance, safety margins).
   * Example: Communication delay between Earth & Mars must be accounted for in mission control software.

2. **Strict Coding Standards & Reviews**

   * Follow international standards (e.g., **NASA Software Engineering Handbook, MISRA**).
   * Apply **code inspections, peer reviews, static analysis** to eliminate defects early.

3. **Extensive Testing Strategy**

   * **Unit Testing:** Validate smallest modules.
   * **Integration Testing:** Ensure subsystems interact correctly.
   * **System Testing:** Full spacecraft system under simulated conditions.
   * **Acceptance Testing:** Final verification before launch.
   * Use of **hardware-in-the-loop testing** to simulate actual space conditions (radiation, low gravity, limited power).

4. **Reliability and Fault Tolerance**

   * Plan for **redundancy (backup modules, multiple processors)**.
   * Implement **self-checks and fail-safe mechanisms**.
   * Example: Autonomous navigation software on rovers to handle delayed commands.

5. **Verification & Validation (V\&V)**

   * Independent V\&V teams check **conformance to requirements**.
   * Formal methods (mathematical proofs, model checking) used for critical software (guidance, control).

6. **Risk Management & Continuous Monitoring**

   * Identify possible risks (software-hardware mismatches, environmental disturbances).
   * Develop **contingency plans**.
   * Example: If primary communication fails, switch to backup frequency automatically.

### **Real-World Examples**

* **Failure Case:** *NASA Mars Climate Orbiter (1999)*

  * Reason: Software used **imperial units** while another system used **metric units**.
  * Impact: Spacecraft lost → \$125 million failure → highlights need for **strict requirement validation**.

* **Success Case:** *ISRO Chandrayaan-3 (2023)*

  * Rigorous **simulation-based testing and redundancy planning** ensured successful soft landing on the Moon despite previous failures.

✅ **Key Point for Exams:**
Planning SQC in space research requires **clear requirements, strict coding standards, exhaustive testing (including simulations), reliability assurance, independent V\&V, and risk management**, as even a **tiny software error can lead to mission failure**.
