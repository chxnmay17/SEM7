# Planning Software Quality Control with Respect to College Attendance Software

### **Definition**

* **Software Quality Control (SQC):** Ensures that the attendance system meets **accuracy, usability, security, and reliability standards**.
* For college systems, software must be **error-free, user-friendly, and secure**, since it directly impacts **students’ academic records** and **faculty workload**.

### **Steps in Planning SQC for College Attendance Software**

1. **Requirement Analysis & Validation**

   * Define clear requirements:

     * Marking attendance (manual/digital/biometric).
     * Report generation (daily, monthly, semester).
     * Integration with student portal.
   * Validate requirements with faculty and admin.

2. **Coding Standards & Peer Reviews**

   * Use **secure coding practices** (prevent duplicate entries, SQL injection).
   * Apply peer review to ensure data handling (attendance logs, student IDs) is correct.

3. **Testing Strategy**

   * **Unit Testing:** Test login, attendance marking, report generation modules.
   * **Integration Testing:** Ensure student database works with attendance module.
   * **System Testing:** Test full workflow (faculty login → mark attendance → generate report).
   * **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Faculty/admin test usability before deployment.

4. **Reliability and Data Accuracy**

   * Ensure **no duplicate/missing entries**.
   * Backup mechanism for database failures.
   * Example: Auto-save attendance if system crashes.

5. **Verification & Validation (V\&V)**

   * Independent testers validate data accuracy.
   * Compare with manual records to ensure correctness.

6. **Risk Management & Security**

   * Prevent unauthorized access (role-based login).
   * Encrypt sensitive data (student IDs, personal info).
   * Backup & recovery plans for server failures.

### **Real-World Example**

* If attendance software has a **bug in date handling**, it may incorrectly mark absentees → leading to disputes.
* A well-tested system like **ERP-based attendance modules (used in many colleges)** prevents such issues by ensuring **real-time updates and error checks**.

✅ **Key Point for Exams:**
Planning SQC for college attendance software involves **validating requirements, secure coding, systematic testing, ensuring reliability, independent verification, and strong risk/security management**, since **accuracy and trust are critical in academic records**.
