# Total Quality Management (TQM) – Principles of Continual Improvement

**Definition:**

* Total Quality Management (TQM) is a management approach focused on **continuous improvement of processes, products, and services** by involving all employees and meeting customer requirements.
* Continual improvement is a **core principle** of TQM, ensuring that quality is not a one-time goal but an **ongoing process**.

## Principles of Continual Improvement in TQM

1. **Customer Focus**

   * Quality improvement must start from understanding and meeting **customer needs**.
   * Example: A software company collecting user feedback to release bug-free updates.

2. **Process Approach**

   * Improvements target **processes**, not just final products.
   * Example: Automating test cases to reduce human error in software testing.

3. **Employee Involvement**

   * Every employee contributes to improvement, from developers to testers.
   * Encourages suggestions, teamwork, and ownership of quality.

4. **PDCA Cycle (Plan–Do–Check–Act)**

   * A systematic method for continual improvement.
   * **Plan:** Identify problems and set goals.
   * **Do:** Implement changes.
   * **Check:** Monitor results.
   * **Act:** Standardize successful practices.

   ```
   [Plan] → [Do] → [Check] → [Act] → (Cycle repeats for continual improvement)
   ```

5. **Fact-Based Decision Making**

   * Improvements should be guided by data (defect density, test coverage, failure rates).

6. **Benchmarking & Innovation**

   * Compare with industry standards and adopt new practices for better quality.

## Real-World Example (Software Context)

* In Agile software development, **retrospectives** at the end of each sprint focus on "what went well" and "what can be improved," ensuring **continuous quality improvement**.

✅ **Key Point for Exams:**
Continual improvement in TQM means **quality is never static**; it evolves through small, consistent improvements involving **processes, people, and customer feedback** using tools like **PDCA cycle, data-driven analysis, and benchmarking**.
