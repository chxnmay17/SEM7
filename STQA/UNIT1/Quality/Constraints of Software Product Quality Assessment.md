# Constraints of Software Product Quality Assessment

**Definition:**
Software quality assessment is the process of **evaluating a software product** against defined standards (ISO 9126, ISO 25010) in terms of functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability, and portability.
However, this assessment is subject to several **constraints**.

---

## Key Constraints

1. **Subjectivity of Quality Attributes**

   * Attributes like *usability* or *user satisfaction* are hard to measure objectively.
   * Example: Two users may rate the same UI differently.

2. **Incomplete or Vague Requirements**

   * If requirements are unclear, assessment becomes inconsistent.
   * Example: “The system should be fast” → unclear metric.

3. **Resource Limitations**

   * Time, budget, and skilled manpower may restrict thorough testing.
   * Example: Only partial test coverage due to project deadline.

4. **Dynamic Environment**

   * Software quality depends on the operating environment (OS, hardware, network).
   * A product may perform well in one environment but fail in another.

5. **Trade-offs Between Quality Factors**

   * Improving one quality factor may reduce another.
   * Example: Adding heavy security checks may decrease performance.

6. **Measurement Difficulties**

   * Some metrics (like reliability, maintainability) require long-term observation, making assessment challenging.

## Real-World Example

* In mobile apps, **battery usage (efficiency)** vs **security (encryption)** → difficult to optimize both; assessment must balance trade-offs.

✅ **Key Point for Exams:**
Constraints in software product quality assessment arise due to **subjectivity, incomplete requirements, limited resources, environmental factors, trade-offs, and measurement challenges**, making perfect quality evaluation difficult.
