## **Classification of the Role of Software**

### **Definition**

* Software plays different roles depending on its application and purpose.
* It can be classified into categories based on how it supports users, systems, and processes.

---

### **Classification**

1. **System Software**

   * Manages and controls hardware resources.
   * Provides platform for application software.
   * *Example:* Operating Systems (Windows, Linux), Compilers.

2. **Application Software**

   * Helps users perform specific tasks.
   * Focused on solving domain/user problems.
   * *Example:* MS Word, Banking apps, E-commerce apps.

3. **Engineering/Scientific Software**

   * Performs complex computations and simulations.
   * Used in research, engineering, and scientific fields.
   * *Example:* MATLAB, AutoCAD.

4. **Embedded Software**

   * Built into hardware devices for specific control functions.
   * *Example:* Software in washing machines, cars, routers.

5. **Product-line / Web-based / AI-based Software (Modern Roles)**

   * Software as a product or service (SaaS, cloud, AI tools).
   * *Example:* Google Docs, Chatbots, Cloud storage.

### **Why Important in QA?**

* Testing approaches differ for each role:

  * **System software** → stress & performance testing.
  * **Application software** → functionality & usability testing.
  * **Embedded software** → reliability & safety testing.
* Ensures correct validation according to the role and environment.
