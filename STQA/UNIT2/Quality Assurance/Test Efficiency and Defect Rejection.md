## **Test Efficiency and Defect Rejection**

### **1. Test Efficiency**

* **Definition:** A metric that measures how effectively testing is able to **find defects within the given effort, time, and resources**.
* **Formula:**
  Test Efficiency = (Number of Defects detected in testing / Total Effort spent on testing) × 100
* **Purpose:**

  * Indicates productivity of the testing process.
  * Helps optimize test planning and resource allocation.
* **Example:** If 50 defects are found in 100 testing hours, test efficiency = 50%.

### **2. Defect Rejection**

* **Definition:** The percentage of defects reported by testers that are later **rejected/marked invalid** by developers or reviewers.
* **Formula:**
  Defect Rejection Ratio = (Rejected Defects / Total Reported Defects) × 100
* **Reasons for Rejection:**

  * Duplicate defect raised
  * Not reproducible
  * Not a defect (intended functionality)
* **Purpose:**

  * Measures **accuracy of defect reporting**.
  * High rejection ratio = poor understanding of requirements/test cases.

```
       ┌──────────────────────────┐
       │ Test Efficiency          │ → Measures productivity  
       │ Defect Rejection         │ → Measures accuracy of defect reporting

### **Key Point**

* **High Test Efficiency** → more defects found with less effort.
* **Low Defect Rejection** → better quality and clarity in reporting.
