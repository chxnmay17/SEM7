## **Green Money vs Red Money in Quality Costs**

### **i) Green Money – Cost of Prevention**

* **Nature:** Considered *positive spending* → reduces long-term cost.
* **Examples:**

  * Training developers & testers
  * Code reviews and inspections
  * Test planning and process improvement
* **Justification:**

  * Investing early (green money) ensures fewer defects reach customers.
  * Though it increases initial cost, it reduces expensive rework later.
