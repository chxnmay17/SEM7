## **Quality Assurance (QA) Process**

### **Definition**

* Quality Assurance is a **systematic process** to ensure that software meets **defined standards and customer requirements**.
* Focuses on **preventing defects** rather than just finding them.

---

### **Steps in QA Process**

1. **Requirement Analysis**

   * Understand customer requirements & quality expectations.
   * Example: Reviewing SRS for clarity and completeness.

2. **Planning**

   * Define QA objectives, standards, resources, roles, and responsibilities.
   * Example: Preparing a test plan aligned with QA policy.

3. **Design & Standards Definition**

   * Establish coding guidelines, testing strategies, and review checklists.
   * Example: Using ISO/CMMI or organizational standards.

4. **Implementation of Processes**

   * Apply reviews, inspections, and audits during development.
   * Example: Code review before integration.

5. **Testing & Verification**

   * Conduct different levels of testing (unit, integration, system, acceptance).
   * Example: Functional and non-functional tests.

6. **Measurement & Analysis**

   * Collect quality metrics (defect density, test coverage, reliability).
   * Example: Defect trend analysis.

7. **Continuous Improvement**

   * Feedback loop to refine processes for future projects.
   * Example: Root cause analysis and corrective actions.
