## **Difference between Verification and Validation**

### **1. Verification**

* **Definition:** Process of checking whether the software product is being **built correctly** as per specifications.
* **Focus:** Ensures the product design and development follow requirements.
* **Method:** Reviews, inspections, walkthroughs, static testing.
* **Question Answered:** *“Are we building the product right?”*
* **Example:** Checking SRS, design documents, or code review before execution.

---

### **2. Validation**

* **Definition:** Process of checking whether the software product is the **right product** that meets customer needs.
* **Focus:** Ensures the final product fulfills user expectations and requirements.
* **Method:** Dynamic testing, actual execution of code, user acceptance testing.
* **Question Answered:** *“Are we building the right product?”*
* **Example:** Running test cases on a banking app to ensure money transfer works correctly.

| **Aspect**   | **Verification**                             | **Validation**                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Question** | *Are we building the product right?*         | *Are we building the right product?*                  |
| **Focus**    | Conformance to **specifications or design**  | Conformance to **user needs or requirements**         |
| **Purpose**  | Ensure the product meets **technical specs** | Ensure the product fulfills its **intended use**      |
| **Type**         | Static (without code execution)    | Dynamic (with code execution)      |
| **Timing**   | Done **during development**                  | Done **after or at the end of development**           |
| **Methods**  | Reviews, inspections, walkthroughs, testing  | User testing, feedback, beta testing, pilots          |
| **Example**  | "Does the code follow the design doc?"       | "Does the product actually solve the user's problem?" |
| **Performed By** | Developers, QA team                | Testers, End-users                 |
| **Example**      | Reviewing SRS, design, code        | Executing test cases, UAT          |

### **Key Point**

* **Verification** prevents defects by ensuring correctness in process.
* **Validation** detects defects by ensuring correctness in product.
