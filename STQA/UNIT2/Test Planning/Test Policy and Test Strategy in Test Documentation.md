## **Test Policy and Test Strategy in Test Documentation**

### **1. Test Policy**

* **Definition:** A **high-level document** that defines the **organization‚Äôs overall objectives and principles of testing**.
* **Purpose:** Ensures testing aligns with **business goals** and quality standards.
* **Key Points:**

  * Defines **testing objectives** (e.g., defect prevention, risk reduction).
  * Establishes **responsibilities and roles** in testing.
  * Provides **long-term vision** for quality assurance.
* **Example:** An IT company‚Äôs test policy may state: *‚ÄúAll products must undergo functional and security testing before release.‚Äù*

---

### **2. Test Strategy**

* **Definition:** A **high-level plan** derived from the test policy that describes the **approach, techniques, and standards** for testing.
* **Purpose:** Guides *how testing should be performed* across projects.
* **Key Points:**

  * Defines **testing levels** (unit, integration, system, acceptance).
  * Specifies **test design techniques** (black-box, white-box, risk-based).
  * Defines **defect severity levels, tools, and automation guidelines**.
* **Example:** An organization‚Äôs test strategy may mandate: *‚ÄúUse automation for regression testing and risk-based testing for critical modules.‚Äù*
