## **Configuration Management (CM)**

### **Definition**

* Configuration Management is a **systematic process** of organizing, controlling, and tracking changes in software throughout its lifecycle.
* Ensures **consistency, integrity, and traceability** of software products.

---

### **Explanation / Key Points**

* **Purpose:** To manage and control versions, updates, and modifications of software artifacts.
* **Scope:** Source code, documents, test cases, design specifications, and tools.
* **Functions of CM:**

  1. **Configuration Identification** – Identifying software items to be controlled.
  2. **Configuration Control** – Managing changes via change requests/approvals.
  3. **Configuration Status Accounting** – Recording and reporting current status of items.
  4. **Configuration Audit** – Ensuring items conform to requirements and standards.

### **Real-World Example**

* In a **banking application**, CM ensures that the correct version of code, design docs, and test cases are used while deploying updates (e.g., for new UPI feature).

---

### **Key Point**

* **Why important in Testing & QA?**

  * Avoids confusion due to multiple versions.
  * Maintains **traceability** from requirements → design → code → test.
  * Ensures reliable delivery of the software product.
